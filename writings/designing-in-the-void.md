There's a moment before every project begins — a suspended breath between conception and creation — where nothing exists yet everything is possible. This is **the void**: not empty, but pregnant with potential.

Most designers fear this space. They rush to fill it with references, precedents, familiar patterns. But what if we stayed here longer? What if we learned to *design from* the void rather than *away from* it?

## The Practice of Unknowing

Traditional design education teaches us to accumulate — techniques, styles, tools, references. We build arsenals of solutions waiting for problems. But this accumulation can become armor, protecting us from the discomfort of genuine uncertainty.

The practice I'm proposing isn't about forgetting what you know. It's about [holding knowledge loosely](#) — available when needed, but not determining the shape of what hasn't yet emerged.

### Three Principles

- **Resist premature clarity.** The urge to "figure it out" is often the urge to escape discomfort. Stay in the question longer than feels comfortable.
- **Document the negative space.** What you choose *not* to do is as defining as what you create. Make those decisions visible.
- **Trust emergence.** The best work often arrives — it isn't forced. Create conditions for arrival.

This essay is an artifact of its own methodology. I began with only a title and a feeling. The structure emerged through writing — through staying in the void until shapes became visible.

What void are you avoiding?
