An immersive installation exploring the boundaries between presence and absence. Visitors navigate a darkened space where their movements trigger cascading light responses that map the negative space around them.

## Concept

Void Protocol investigates the philosophical concept of negative space as an active force. Rather than illuminating where visitors are, the system reveals where they are not, creating an inverse shadow that follows their presence through the gallery.

The installation responds to the Buddhist concept of sunyata (emptiness) and the quantum mechanical idea that observation changes the observed. As visitors move, they become aware of the space they leave behind, the voids they create.

## Technical

Built using LiDAR scanning arrays, real-time point cloud processing, and programmable LED matrices. The system calculates volumetric negative space at 60fps, translating absence into luminous form.

Custom shaders written in GLSL handle the real-time inversion calculations, while a distributed network of Raspberry Pi units controls individual light clusters. The entire installation runs without a central server, each node communicating through a mesh network protocol.

## Exhibition

Premiered at the New Museum's "Light/Anti-Light" exhibition in February 2025.
