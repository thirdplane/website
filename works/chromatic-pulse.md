A series of audiovisual compositions exploring the synesthetic relationship between color and rhythm. Each piece translates musical structures into pure chromatic motion, creating a visual language for sound.

## Concept

Chromatic Pulse treats color as a temporal medium. Rather than static palettes, colors exist as frequencies, wavelengths that pulse and shift in response to musical input. The project asks: what if we could see sound not as waveforms, but as living color?

Inspired by the work of synesthetic artists like Kandinsky and the color organs of the 1920s, Chromatic Pulse uses modern computational techniques to realize these early visions of color-music correspondence.

## Technical

Audio analysis using FFT and spectral decomposition drives real-time color generation. Each frequency band maps to specific hue ranges, while amplitude controls saturation and tempo influences brightness transitions.

Built in TouchDesigner with custom Python operators for audio analysis. The final compositions were rendered at 4K 60fps and encoded in HDR to preserve the full chromatic range.

## Output

The series consists of 12 compositions, each responding to a different musical genre, from ambient drone to breakcore. The collection was released as an NFT series and exhibited at digital art festivals throughout 2023.
