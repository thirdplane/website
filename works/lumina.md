## Overview

Lumina is a comprehensive brand identity system designed for an AI-powered creative tools platform. The project encompassed visual identity, motion design language, and a complete design system.

## Challenge

The client needed a brand that communicated both technical sophistication and creative warmth. The identity had to work across digital products, marketing materials, and developer documentation.

## Approach

We developed a generative visual system based on light refraction patterns. The logo itself is a dynamic mark that responds to user interaction, symbolizing the adaptive nature of AI tools.

### Color System

The palette balances warm gradients with cool technical accents:
- Primary: Luminous amber to coral gradient
- Secondary: Deep violet for contrast
- Neutral: Sophisticated gray scale with blue undertones

### Typography

We paired **Space Grotesk** for display text with **Inter** for body copy, creating a balance between personality and readability.

## Outcome

The new identity launched across all touchpoints in Q3 2024. Early metrics show a 40% increase in brand recognition among the target developer audience.
