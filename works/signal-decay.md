An exploration of entropy and information loss through generative visual systems. Signal Decay creates images that degrade in real-time, visualizing the inevitable march toward disorder that governs all systems.

## Concept

Every signal decays. Every message degrades. Signal Decay embraces this inevitability, treating entropy not as an enemy but as a creative partner. The project generates pristine digital images and then subjects them to systematic destruction.

Inspired by the aesthetics of VHS decay, JPEG artifacts, and bitrot, Signal Decay creates beauty from degradation. The most compelling moments often occur not in the original image but in its dissolution.

## Technical

A multi-stage corruption pipeline processes generated images through various forms of decay: JPEG recompression cascades, deliberate bit manipulation, simulated magnetic tape degradation, and custom glitch algorithms.

The generative system that creates the source images uses recursive subdivision and color field techniques. Each image begins as a geometric composition before being subjected to the decay process.

Built in Processing with custom Java extensions for low-level bit manipulation. The system can run in real-time, showing decay as it happens, or generate high-resolution stills at various stages of degradation.

## Output

A collection of 500 unique pieces was generated, each showing different stages and types of decay. The series was exhibited as a triptych format showing pristine, mid-decay, and near-dissolution states.
