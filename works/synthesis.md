## Overview

Synthesis is an exploration of emergent patterns through computational design. The project combines noise algorithms, particle systems, and real-time rendering to create evolving visual compositions.

## Concept

Inspired by natural phenomena—flocking behavior, crystal growth, fluid dynamics—Synthesis generates unique artworks that emerge from simple rules applied iteratively.

## Technical Approach

The system is built on three core algorithms:

### Flow Fields

Vector fields guide particle movement, creating organic flowing patterns reminiscent of wind or water currents.

### Reaction-Diffusion

Based on Alan Turing's morphogenesis model, this creates biological-looking patterns that emerge from the interaction of two virtual chemicals.

### L-Systems

Recursive growth patterns generate fractal structures that echo plant growth and branching forms.

## Output

The project has produced a series of 100 unique generative artworks, each seeded from environmental data collected during the creation process.

## Exhibition

Synthesis was exhibited at the Digital Art Festival 2024, where visitors could interact with a real-time version of the generative system.
