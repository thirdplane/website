A live coding performance system that generates visuals from real-time data streams. Data Mirage treats APIs as instruments, market feeds as melodies, and server logs as rhythms, performing the hidden music of network traffic.

## Concept

Behind every API response is a story. Data Mirage tells these stories through abstract visualization and sonification, revealing patterns and rhythms in data that typically passes unnoticed through our machines.

The project positions the programmer as performer and data as medium. Live coding becomes a form of data journalism, excavating meaning from the digital exhaust of networked systems.

## Technical

A custom live coding environment built on top of Hydra and Tidal Cycles provides the performance interface. Data ingestion modules connect to various APIs: cryptocurrency exchanges, weather services, social media streams, and transit systems.

Pattern recognition algorithms identify rhythmic structures in incoming data, which are then mapped to both visual and sonic parameters. The performer's code modifies these mappings in real-time, shaping the data into coherent audiovisual compositions.

WebSocket connections ensure minimal latency between data events and their audiovisual manifestation. The system can handle hundreds of events per second while maintaining visual coherence.

## Performances

Data Mirage has been performed at Algorave events and digital art festivals. Each performance is unique, determined by the live data flowing through the system at that moment. No two shows are alike.
