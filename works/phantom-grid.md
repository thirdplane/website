A real-time visualization of electromagnetic field fluctuations in urban environments. Phantom Grid reveals the invisible infrastructure that surrounds us, making visible the wireless signals, radio waves, and electrical fields we inhabit.

## Concept

Modern cities are layered with invisible networks. WiFi, cellular, radio, power lines, and countless other electromagnetic sources create a dense, overlapping phantom architecture. Phantom Grid makes this hidden city visible.

The project draws from the tradition of urban psychogeography, but extends it into the electromagnetic spectrum. Walking through a city with Phantom Grid is like seeing through walls, perceiving the pulse of data flowing around and through us.

## Technical

Custom SDR (Software Defined Radio) arrays capture electromagnetic activity across a wide frequency range (1 MHz to 6 GHz). Real-time spectral analysis identifies signal types and sources.

The visualization engine, built in Three.js with custom WebGL shaders, renders the EM data as volumetric fields that pulse and flow with signal strength. GPS integration maps the captured data to physical space, building up a persistent model of the local EM environment.

## Applications

Beyond its artistic intent, Phantom Grid has found practical applications in urban planning and RF site surveys. A mobile version runs on modified Android devices for field research.
