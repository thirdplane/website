An adaptive sound environment that evolves based on the acoustic signatures of its listeners. Echo Chamber creates a unique sonic space for each visitor, using their voice and movements to sculpt an ever-changing soundscape.

## Concept

We are constantly surrounded by echoes we cannot hear. Echo Chamber amplifies these hidden resonances, revealing the acoustic fingerprint of each individual and the way sound shapes and is shaped by physical space.

The installation challenges the notion of passive listening. Every visitor becomes a collaborator, their presence fundamentally altering the sonic environment for themselves and others. The boundary between performer and audience dissolves.

## Technical

Spatial audio array with 64 channels creates a true 3D sound field. Real-time convolution reverb using impulse responses captured from the visitor's own vocalizations generates personalized acoustic spaces.

Machine learning models trained on voice analysis identify emotional states and adjust the harmonic content accordingly. The system uses granular synthesis to stretch, compress, and transform recorded sounds while maintaining natural qualities.

Custom software built in Max/MSP with Python extensions handles the ML inference, while spatial audio rendering uses custom ambisonic decoders optimized for the specific installation geometry.
